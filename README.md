A simple game which the player choose one of the predetermined characters and fight a horde of enemy monsters by
choosing what to do on their turn such as attack, defence etc. The
player will fight a different number of enemies each time they play
and win by eliminating all monsters or if the enemies manage to
bring down the player’s health to zero, the player will lose. Enemies
will either attack or defence on their turns.
